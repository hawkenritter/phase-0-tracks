  <h1>Reasons to love UCSB</h1>
    <p> There are countless reasons why I want my future kids to go to UCSB. After spending the last four years here are a few reasons why I love this place so much. </p>
      <ol>
        <li>It is located right next to the ocean</li>
        <li>It is a top ranked research institution</li>
        <li>It is an <em>extremely</em> social place, helping build the social skills that allow you to excel in the workplace</li>
        <li>Isla Vista, the student city, is one of the <b>most amazing places</b> to live in the US</li>
        <li>The list could go on...</li>
      </ol>
  <h2> Activities available to UCSB Students </h2>
      <p> One of my favorite things about UCSB is its proximity to the Ocean, and all of the aquatic sports available to those who live here. Below is a list of the activities I do in an average week</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Surf at Deveroux or Campus Point, <strong>these waves are <em>sooo</em> fun</strong></li>
        <li>Stand-Up Paddle Board to the kelp beds or oil rig</li>
        <li>Kayak/float with friends</li>
        <li>Free dive in the kelp beds or spear fish in Gaviota</li>
        <li>Swim laps in one of campus's outdoor pools</li>
        <li>Play pick up basketball outside or at the recenter courts</li>
      </ul>
