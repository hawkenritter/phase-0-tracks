What are some common HTTP status codes:
2xx i.e. 200 or 201 etc indicates that the client GET request was successfully received, understood and accepted. 200 is the status code you want to see.

3xx i.e. 300 or 301 indicated that further action is required to fulfill the request made by the client.

4xx Stands for client error. Most people have seen the 404 code which stands for website Not Found. This means the server didn't have anything that matched the request sent by the browser.

5xx stands for server error. The server is aware of an error and can't fulfill the request. 500 stands for Internal server error which means that there is some sort of unexpected condition which prevented it from fulfilling the request.
