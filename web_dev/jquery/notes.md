Strategy for Learning JQuery:
1. Find a youtube tutorial/overview so that I can understand from a high level the purpose of jquery.

2. Skim my book on javascript and jquery. Stop at a few sections along the way that look the most important and try to code through the example.

3. Come up with a jquery task to make and start the process of figuring it out. I think working toward a goal is a faster way to learn what you need to know to be proficient at something like jquery.
