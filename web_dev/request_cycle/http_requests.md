2. What are some common HTTP status codes:
2xx i.e. 200 or 201 etc indicates that the client GET request was successfully received, understood and accepted. 200 is the status code you want to see.

3xx i.e. 300 or 301 indicated that further action is required to fulfill the request made by the client.

4xx Stands for client error. Most people have seen the 404 code which stands for website Not Found. This means the server didn't have anything that matched the request sent by the browser.

5xx stands for server error. The server is aware of an error and can't fulfill the request. 500 stands for Internal server error which means that there is some sort of unexpected condition which prevented it from fulfilling the request.

3. What is the difference between the GET request and a POST request? When is each used?
A GET request happens when your browser requests data from a specified resource. A get request just retrieves data from the server.
A Post request happens when you want the server to accept the data enclosed in the body of your request. This might happen if you are filling out a web application or something where you are sending information that you want the server to store.

4. What is a HTTP Cookie?
A Cookie is basically a file that is stored by servers that stores client's information. At first they were used to save preferences such as english or location, but now they use Cookie ID's to just label clients allowing for more information to be stored on websites own servers. Cookies allow for tailored add campaigns and customer tracking.
