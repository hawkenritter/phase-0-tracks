1. Display the information in one table (either table is fine).
    Command: select * from airplane_seats
    Output: 1|First Class
            2|Business Class
            3|Coach

2. Update an item that meets some condition (you can choose a condition that makes sense).
    Command: UPDATE airplane_passengers SET diet_restrictions = "true" WHERE name="Jack Abram";
    Output: N/A

3. Display the information in both tables using one query.

    Command:SELECT * FROM airplane_passengers, airplane_seats WHERE airplane_passengers.seat_class_id = airplane_seats.id;

    Output: 1|Jack Abram|true|2|2|Business Class
            2|Cole Rogers|true|1|1|First Class
            3|Hawken Ritter|true|1|1|First Class
            4|Clay Wilson|false|3|3|Coach

4. Display a narrower selection of columns (fewer columns than all of them, in other words) from both tables using one query.

    Command: SELECT airplane_passengers.name, airplane_seats.name FROM airplane_passengers JOIN airplane_seats ON airplane_passengers.seat_class_id = airplane_seats.id;

    Output:Jack Abram|Business Class
                Cole Rogers|First Class
                Hawken Ritter|First Class
                Clay Wilson|Coach

5. Delete an item that meets some condition (you can choose a condition that makes sense).

    Command:DELETE FROM airplane_passengers WHERE name="Cole Rogers";
    Output: N/A
